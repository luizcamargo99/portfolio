        <p class="subtitulo">Mayara's fianc√©, son of Alessandro and Paula and grandson of Mrs. Geni, I was born in the state of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. The year was 1999, almost at the turn of the millennium.</p>
        <p class="subtitulo">In my spare time, I like to watch series, order food in apps, chat and also develop some apps.</p>
        <p class="subtitulo">As I write this, I am just doing this: creating this personal website and waiting for lunch to arrive. Then I'll take a break to watch series.</p>
        <p class="subtitulo">My greatest quality in my opinion is my ability to not hold grudges. I discovered this yesterday. I think it's a good quality, I prefer not to feed on bad thoughts and things.</p>
        <p class="subtitulo">My first contact with the programming world was in mid-2014, when I was just 15 years old. For some reason I discovered an MIT website called App inventor, and there I saw how it worked and learned how to use the tool by creating Android apps without even knowing anything about programming. I just used the tool's blocks and forum tips. As a result, I took a lot of unconscious baggage for logic and a flame inside me to build applications, and, at the time, I didn't even know what programming actually was. But I knew that I liked what happened.</p>
        <p class="subtitulo">If you've come this far, thank you in advance for taking the time to read this short summary, it was nice talking to you. Hope to meet you soon.</p>

         <p class="subtitulo">
           At Aka Tecnologia, a software factory I was assigned to joining the Safetychem system team of a client named Intertox.
           Safetychem is a web application that many companies use to optimize their process of issuing and managing chemical safety documents. In compliance with current Brazilian and international standards and legislation, I worked on this system during these two years.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitulo">
          Within the project I worked from bug fixes to implementations of new modules according to the RoadMap.
              According to the experience I gained within the project, in addition to developing, I performed onboarding tasks with the younger ones who were joining the project, performing code reviews on them and following their professional evolution.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitulo">
          Before the end of my time at this incredible company, I was assigned to create the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safetychem.mobile" target="blank" class="links">Safetychem Mobile</a> application whose main objective is to generate synchronized documents for the registered company, where I created it from the server side, with the construction of the API in C#, as the client side, using Flutter as an ally.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitulo">
          It was a great experience, as I created the application from scratch, defined the structure with the help of the team and used the necessary design patterns.

          DP World has the largest private terminal in Brazil, where I had the opportunity to have my first real-world experience as a developer.
         </p>
         <p class="subtitulo">
          I joined DP World on a 1 month summer internship program. At the end of this 1 month internship I had to present a project. The directors liked my project so much that I was hired for 2 years to be part of the team as an intern.
         </p>
         <p class="subtitulo">
          My day-to-day consisted of meeting internally the demands of the port's employees, as the clients of the systems opened cases. Also there was an external system for scheduling the container part and an internal system used by employees at work.
         </p>
         <p class="subtitulo">
          In fact, it was in this experience that I got the resilience to analyze code and fix bugs, deal with people in the work environment and confirmed that this (programming) was what I wanted for my life.

Working with him was an experience that helped me develop my trouble solving skills and shaped the way I deal with doubts and challenges nowadays: tackling them head on, not fearing having to ask for help and being twice as eager to help others (and learn while doing it). I am truly thankful for the opportunity of working with him and having him as a mentor, as it was a gamechanger for me.</p>
