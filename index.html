                     <p class="subtitle">I'm <b class="my_name">Luiz Camargo</b>, a Brazilian Software Engineer passionate for solving problems and create new things.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">Mayara's husband, son of Alessandro and Paula and grandson of Mrs. Geni, I was born in the state of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. The year was 1999, almost at the turn of the millennium.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">In my spare time, I like to watch series, order food in apps, chat and also develop some apps.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">As I write this, I am just doing this: creating this personal website and waiting for lunch to arrive. Then I'll take a break to watch series.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">My greatest quality in my opinion is my ability to not hold grudges. I discovered this yesterday. I think it's a good quality, I prefer not to feed on bad thoughts and things.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">My first contact with the programming world was in mid-2014, when I was just 15 years old. For some reason I discovered an MIT website called App inventor, and there I saw how it worked and learned how to use the tool by creating Android apps without even knowing anything about programming. I just used the tool's blocks and forum tips. As a result, I took a lot of unconscious baggage for logic and a flame inside me to build applications, and, at the time, I didn't even know what programming actually was. But I knew that I liked what happened.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">If you've come this far, thank you in advance for taking the time to read this short summary, it was nice talking to you. Hope to meet you soon.</p>

                   <p class="subtitle">HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, C#, .NET Framework, NHibernate, ASP.NET MVC, Git, SQL Server, Visual Studio, Azure DevOps</p>
                   <p class="subtitle">Decskill is a Portuguese Consultant, where I was assigned to one of its clients to work actively at ANEPC (National Authority for Emergency and Civil Protection), to maintain, manage and implement new features in a State Software, SADO.</p>
                   <p class="subtitle">All occurrences and reports are managed in the software for Portuguese entities, nationwide. That is, if you live in Portugal and an accident occurs in yours street, this is registered in the SADO.</p>
                   <p class="subtitle">Within the project, I initially carried out the deployment of DevOps in the project using the Azure tool, so that I and the other developer who was there could better organize ourselves in the tasks performed.</p> 
                   <p class="subtitle">In addition to installing version control with Git in the application, where, together with the Azure DevOps repository service, it is possible to perform Pull Requests and work as a team in an efficient and modern way.</p> 
                   <p class="subtitle">I actively participated in a major change in the system at the Location level, where the entire system was based on District and it was necessary to start using Sub-Region and Region. Doing requirement analysis with the stackholders and refactoring the system for the new reality together with the database.</p> 
                   <p class="subtitle">Every implementation of the change was done in a development environment to be possible tests and flexibility in the changes without impacts in production. </p> 
                   <p class="subtitle">Working with an ASP.NET MVC Web project and with complementary projects that in the end are the assemblies referenced in the application. Separated by layers of Service and also by Data, using the Repository Standard for separation of data access.</p> 
                   <p class="subtitle">Working with Interfaces and following principles such as Dependency Inversion from SOLID, where we must depend on abstractions and not on implementations, and whenever possible refactoring the code to follow best practices. This week, I transformed a 22-line function into a 4-line function, gaining readability and performance. Was cool :D</p>

                   <p class="subtitle">I integrate the development team with bug fixes on the platform and adding new features to the system with well thought out strategies and respecting principles such as Clean Code and SOLID.</p>
                   <p class="subtitle">Teamwork, collaborating with the team and planning to optimize time and deliver the proposal for a sprint in order to add value to the company/client.</p>
                   <p class="subtitle">Using Azure Devops for Sprint planning and control, where agile methodology was followed, participation in supervised meetings with the team and retrospectives for time to have a gradual evolution.</p>  
                   <p class="subtitle">Main responsibilities:</p>  
                   <p class="subtitle">- Development of testable applications. From actions in the database with SQL, their respective mappings in the code using edmx. Where it was made, all the creation of the business logic in the Back End using .NET with C#, from versions of the old Framework to the Core, such as 3.1, 5 and even 6. Being done, the client-side integration with ASP NET and AngularJS. For unit tests XUnit was used.</p>

                   <p class="subtitle">- Creation of standard software class template and code snippets. A class was frequently used in the development of the system, and each time it was necessary to copy the code from an existing one and adapt it to the current context. Thus, I used the Item Template tool, and created an extension containing this class with some variations along with call-to-action snippets and uploaded it to the Visual Studio Marketplace, internally. Thus, facilitating and speeding up the development of the team.</p>

                        Safetychem is a web application that many companies use to optimize their process of issuing and managing chemical safety documents. In compliance with current Brazilian and international standards and legislation, I worked on this system during these two years.

                     <p class="testimonial_phrase">Luiz was responsible for onboarding and mentoring me on my first project at Aka Tecnologia and he did an amazing job. Working with him was an experience that helped me develop my trouble solving skills and shaped the way I deal with doubts and challenges nowadays: tackling them head on, not fearing having to ask for help and being twice as eager to help others (and learn while doing it). I am truly thankful for the opportunity of working with him and having him as a mentor, as it was a gamechanger for me.</p>

                     <p class="testimonial_phrase" style="font-size: 1rem;">Luiz was my trainer in an internship in web development (C#, JavaScript, HTML) and N1 support, in 2019. Sociable and didactic, he was always concerned that he understood all the development processes, without failing to deliver the necessary results to the team, which shows how responsible and competent he is. Communicative and focused, when facing challenges he was not ashamed to ask others, working in sync with the team and not being afraid to face challenges. At the end of the contract, we developed a project together in which I am proud to have gone straight to production. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him and to still keep in touch, because in addition to being a great professional, he is a great person, good and reliable.</p>
